# Word-Guess-Game
Zeke Graves Javascript Homework

This application is a word guessing game modelled on the old standard "Hangman." 

The user attempts to guess the letters of the hidden word one by one until they've completed the word sucessfully, or they have run out of guesses (10 in this case.) A new word is then immediately chosen by the application.

The theme of the words is Sci-Fi Movie Titles (they are all one-word titles in this case.)
Future development of the game will introduce multi-word titles.

The app cycles through an array of words in order, rather than choosing a word randomly from the array. When there are no more words, the user will receive a message and the game ends.
Future development of the game will introduce randomly chosen, non-repeating words.

The app includes some minimal CSS styling.
Future development of the game will introduce improved styling and responsiveness for different viewports.
